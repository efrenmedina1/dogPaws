        We welcome you to the freshest concept for dog mating!
      </h1>
      <h4>
        At last! You may stop asking your neighbours or friends if they own, or have seen a dog like yours that
        wants
        to mate. Now you can stop running like a maniac to strangers when you see that they are accompanied by a
        companion animal that’s the same dog breed as yours, and of course you can stop buying teddy bears, pillows
        etc. to temporarily satisfy your dog’s natural need for breeding until you find a real mate for him/her.

        Our job is to make your life easy and your dog happy.

        Dogpaws.com provides you with an easy, fun, and serious way to find, not just a mate, but the perfect mate
        for
        your loving companion animal. Our main goal is to make you proud by making your dog a dad or a mum and, why
        not, to add an offspring to your extended family. Create your dog’s profile, and dogpaws.com will offer you
        a
        wide choice of available mates for your dog. Select your favorite or favorites and
        contact them to set a date. Your dog and its mate will do the rest!

        You can also vote by hitting the like button for your preferable dog mates, so they can be famous! In the
        same way, others vote for your
        dog, and you never know…maybe he/she will be the one to enter the celebrity community of dogpaws.com.


        We hope that you enjoy dogpaws.com as much as we did when we conceived and decided to implement this
        concept.
