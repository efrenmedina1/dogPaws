      <h2> 
        We welcome you to the freshest concept for dog mating!
      </h2>
      <p class="statement">
        At last! You may stop asking your neighbours or friends if they own, or have seen a dog like yours that wants to mate. Now you can stop running like a maniac to strangers when you see that they are accompanied by a companion animal that’s the same dog breed as yours, and of course you can stop buying teddy bears, pillows etc. to temporarily satisfy your dog’s natural need for breeding until you find a real mate for him/her.

            Our job is to make your life easy and your dog happy.

            Dogpaws.com provides you with an easy, fun, and serious way to find, not just a mate, but the perfect mate for your loving companion animal. Our main goal is to make you proud by making your dog a dad or a mum and, why not, to add an offspring to your extended family. Create your dog’s profile, and dogpaws.com will offer you a wide choice of available mates that look and weigh similar to your dog. Select your favorite or favorites and contact them to set a date. Your dog and its mate will do the rest!

            You can also vote for your preferable dog mates, so they can be famous! In the same way, others vote for your dog, and you never know…maybe he/she will be the one to enter the celebrity community of dogpaws.com.
            
           
            We hope that you enjoy the dogpaws.com as we did when we conceived and decided to implement this concept.
